Description: A collection of data processing tools and helpers primarily motivated by Remote Sensing FORest INVenTory related operations. 
        Notable functionality is running FUSION lidar proecessing tools especially raster <-> .dtm (FUSION raster), gridmetrics, 
        treeseg, canopyModel, and a package specific project format that manages lidar tile overlap with .dtm files for 
        large areas. This functionality is similar to areaprocessor (FUSION) or catalogs (lidR) but works with FUSION and
        can handle huge areas. The package also includes wrappers for a subset of functions in the dll for the Nationval Volume 
        Estimator Library (NVEL) . There is also some developing functionality for field data compilation including compileTree
        and compilePlot (rudimentary).
