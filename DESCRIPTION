Description: A hodgepodge of data processing tools, primarily motivated by FORest INVentory and related Remote Sensing operations. 
        Notable functionality is running FUSION lidar proecessing tools especially raster <-> .dtm (FUSION raster), gridmetrics, treeseg, canopyModel, and a package
        specific project format that manages lidar tile overlap with .dtm files for large areas. This functionality is similar to areaprocessor (FUSION) or
        projects (lidR) but works with FUSION and can handle huge areas. The package also includes wrappers for select functions in the dll for the Nationval 
        Volume Estimator Library (NVEL) . There is also some developing functionality for field data compilation.This set of tools is free to use but it is provided WITHOUT WARRANTY
